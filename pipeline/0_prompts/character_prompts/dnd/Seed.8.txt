Atreer Havon- Fighter mage. 5'10. On the side of skinny, but certainly not a stick. Relatively well balanced muscle. Born into the noble family of House Havon. Wears traditional Havon armor, with a steel chest plate, brown and Havon red leather around the sides, shoulders and hip, and a chain mail shirt underneath. Left shoulder has a steel pauldron on shoulder. Wields a bastard sword in the right hand, and pyromancies in the left. Occasionally lets his pyromancy drift up the side of his left arm, letting his arm be incased in a gentle, lasting flame that goes to almost his elbow.

Armor has a long, red cloak that attaches underneath the leather shoulder pauldrons and drapes down to the calves when standing upright. Doesn't wear a helmet- hair is dark brown, straight but slightly wavy, and drapes down to the bottom of the cheek. Five o'clock shadow, because badass. Left arm is a light amount of steel- simple gauntlet that protects the hand and extended wrist. Beneath this is a thin leather glove, and the forearm/biceps is comfortable, brown and accented red leather all the way up the arm. Right hand is the same, minus the steel gauntlet- leather glove, then leather all the way up. Legs are just practical, comfortable leather.

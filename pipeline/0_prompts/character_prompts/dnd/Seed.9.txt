Brass Dragonborn forsaken by his nomad tribe and captured by slavers at a young age. He was small compared to other dragonborn but still an effective fighter. He staged a bloody slave revolt to gain his freedom and, looking on the chaos he instigated, he took a vow to never kill or be an instrument of death again.

It takes a lot of prodding to make him fight and while fighting he's completely non-lethal (only compromising once after taking his vow in self defense against a former fighting partner who's technically still 'alive'). Also has a soft spot for little folk. His wife is a Halfling druid who runs a botanical garden.

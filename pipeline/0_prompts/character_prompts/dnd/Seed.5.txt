Talithe the human Anti-Paladin, she has messy, shoulder length black hair, sickly pale skin, zombie like eyes, and a glasgow grin carved into her face. Her armour and shield are a scavenged mess of dozens of different pieces stolen from defeated foes, and her favored weapon is a long spear, which she's somehow able to wield in one hand.

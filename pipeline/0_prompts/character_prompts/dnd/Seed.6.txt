Typhos Silversoul He's an Aasimar ranger from the bloodline of the elven demigod Sheverash posing as a human because of a tragic moment in his past. He has a set of icy blue eyes and dark black hair. His face reveals something of an elven ancestry with fair features and a kind yet determined expression. He wears a deep brown leather cloak to allow him to blend in with the nature he chooses to protect. Strapped to his waist are 3 different weapons meant to deal with varying threats. He also carries a bow and several other ranged weapons for the same reason as his melee weapons. (He's a Monster Slayer) He's not a particularly large man choosing speed and efficiency over a brute strength approach. His thin figure however should not be taken to mean he's any less of a threat. The final most important thing is the necklace he wears: a piece of the infernal Balor Demon that first set him on his quest of vengeance.

An old human bard with close cropped hair and beard named Geth Stormsong. He is normal height but has a bit of a beer gut from drinking with the dwarves in the north where he often quests. He wears coin on cloths but for a deep purple cloak he acquired in a dungeon. Geth also wears two gold rings on the ring finger of his left hand in memory of a wife he had in his youth. She passed in child birth and Geth never sought anyone else. He wears a coin from an unidentifiable land on a cord around his neck from his homeland. People always ask where itâ€™s from but he just smiles and shakes his head. He keeps the old lute slung across his back.

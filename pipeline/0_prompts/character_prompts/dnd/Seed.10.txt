16 year-old Human Wizard, very cocky and full of himself. He got this way because he was really good with magic (his Arcana score is disgustingly high).
He recently got cursed as the center of an Anti-Magic Field by a BBEG, in part because of his hubris and in part because he was being an asshole. My wizard's mental state is pretty much "broken" at this point, as that happened at the end of last session. Going to be fun roleplaying his personal crash and his attempt at atonement.

Vorpal V. Regalia, disowned Drow nobility and cultist of Nyarlathotep. A Vigilante, by day appearing to be Lawful Good, and when called upon to perform a duty in the name of his god, changes to Chaotic Neutral. While his loyalty is unquestioned, he'd overthrow his god and all the followers, even in the name of walking a lighter path, if it meant that the side he was on was one of strength.

Vorpal is pale white, with shoulder-length white hair and green eyes, as well as a stitched scar horizontally across his nose. He can often be seen with a scheming smirk and condescending expression across his face, though his acting skills are such that it's most likely you're only seeing it if he has no intention of hiding his smug attitude.

Day outfit consists of basic studded leather, black leather pants, and a short red cape stretching to halfway down his back. A black cane sword rests at his side, bearing dark runic markings etched along it.

As his Vigilante form, he disguises himself to appear as a human of pale skin color and black hair. He wears a grey iron mask covering his entire face in the shape of a jackal, which has additional black hair covering the back part of his head and falling down, draped to the nape of his neck.

He wears his same studded leather armor hidden underneath a black Victorian-era cloak, with silk grey gloves each with a red eye in the center. His pants are a darkened leather, with various stitches and repairs made to them, giving the appearance as if he's been through many battles. For footwear, he dons dark brown leather work boots, muddy and clearly used to trudge through many a swamp. A rapier adorned with an emerald green gem at its pommel and a jet black polish is sheathed on his left hip.

Overall, his Vigilante outfit tries to give the appearance of a humble night servant that still has some sway in the saying of whether or not his target lives, intending to strike fear into them to lessen the work he needs to do.

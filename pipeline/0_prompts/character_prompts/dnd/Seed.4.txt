young half-elf sorcerer that has patches of scales pertruding on random parts of his skin and eyes that look like somebody fitted eyballs of two times the size in standard size eye sockets. Rather cheerful in both facial and bodily expressions, as well as the clothing. To put it simply, he basicaly seems like he got pulled from a party night.

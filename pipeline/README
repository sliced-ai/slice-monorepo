This is a rewrite and update to the entire generation and training system into one coherent pipeline. 

Core use of this project is to build a system capable of the following:
- Generate large amounts of targeted sythetic data.
- Train a customized model with that sythetic data.
- Enable a RTC with users with their customized data

Core components:
0: All steps & setup run once in support of the pipeline
1. Initial input and generation of core details
2. Generation of raw sythetic data
3. Data analysis and cleaning
4. Preprocessing of data for model
5. Bulk model training / RTC
6. Bulk model eval / feedback for RTC

Data & Experiment Tracking:
- All runs have a UUID
- S3 holds UUID and data in same format as the folder is setup per run

terms:
RTC: real time conversations (fine tuning loop on conversations)
Core Details: data generated for generation of raw sythetic data

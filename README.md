This is my entire research repo for Slice AI

Overall the goal was to find and develop new AI abilities and research and understand the cutting edge of AGI.

There are a lot of different experiments in here, some took a day, some took a month. 

Commits do not reflect time when work occured. Most frequent commits occured when I was using runpod without a shared storage solution.

This is my entire research repo for Slice AI

Overall the goal was to find and develop new AI abilities and research and understand the cutting edge of AGI.

There are a lot of different experiments in here, some took a day, some took a month. 

The notebooks are documentation and reasonings behind all of these test. Most are dated with the info needed to find the coresponding experiment. 



Most experiments follow a format of:

-> Pilot: a naive approach trying to solve something new for a product
-> Validation and testing: Trying to prove or disprove sub components of the main problem
-> Next project: A validation test shows the larger pilot is not possible yet until other components solve

Text comparisons inferencing on LLAMA2 7B chat 9.6.23

temperature: 0.6
top_p: 0.9
- running twice results in identical outputs
- almost perfectly the same

temperature: 0.8
top_p: 0.9
- compared with 0.6t and it is similar but not identical
- getting better

temperature: 0.85
top_p: 0.7
- very different from original
- Nearly the same as the other done at same time
- Output Starting to degrade

Solution:
- generate datasets from different temperature and top_p values
- to generate more I will need to modify the input ("rewrite this bullet point")

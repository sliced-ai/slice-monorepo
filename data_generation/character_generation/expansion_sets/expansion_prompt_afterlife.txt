Below is a description of a story character. This character died, after death their brain was extracted and plugged into a computer.
Give me a bullet point list that goes from describing how they died and ends after they have come to terms with their situation.
It should be early on into this and hasn't done anything yet. He simply has been talking to a nameless researcher.
